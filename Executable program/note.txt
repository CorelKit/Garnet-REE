Before use, download all files and folders in this folder. 
The "models" folder and the ".py" program need to be in the same directory. 
Make sure that the files in ".pkl" format under the "models" folder are not lost.

Use the following code to convert a .py file into an .exe program for Windows system in the command line window of PyCharm.
pyinstaller --clean --onefile --windowed --upx-dir="D:\Program Files\upx-5.0.1-win64" Garnet-REE-Prediction-Tool.py
